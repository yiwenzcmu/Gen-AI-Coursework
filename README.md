# Gen-AI-Coursework

This repository contains the coursework for the Generative AI course (CMU 10423/10623 2024 Spring), which explores the techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence that are driving the recent advances in generative modelling and foundation models. 

# Course Description
From generating images and text to generating music and art, the goal of generative modeling has long been a key challenge for artificial intelligence. This course explores the core topics that enable machines to generate realistic and creative content, including:

- Fundamental mechanisms of learning
- Building generative models and foundation models (e.g., transformers for vision and language, diffusion models)
- Training models (pre-training, fine-tuning) and efficient adaptation (adapters, in-context learning)
- Scaling up to massive datasets (multi-GPU/distributed optimization)
- Employing existing models for everyday use (generating code, coding with a generative model in the loop)


We also explored the theoretical background and practical challenges of generative modelling, including:
- Understanding the inner workings of these models
- Potential issues like bias, hallucination, adversial attacks, and data contamination
- Techniques to mitigate these problems
